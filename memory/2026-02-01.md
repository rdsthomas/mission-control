## 💡 Notes & Insights

### GraphQL Schema Decisions

Decided to use **Relay-style pagination** for all list queries:
```graphql
type TaskConnection {
  edges: [TaskEdge!]!
  pageInfo: PageInfo!
}
```

Reasoning: Better cursor-based pagination, works well with infinite scroll.

### Security Audit Results

Final audit report:
- 0 Critical issues ✅
- 2 Medium (already patched)
- 5 Low (documented, low risk)

Team decided to upgrade bcrypt to v5.1 next week.

## 💡 Notes & Insights

### Performance Results 📈

**Before vs After:**

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| LCP | 2.8s | 1.4s | -50% |
| FCP | 1.2s | 0.8s | -33% |
| Bundle | 450KB | 280KB | -38% |
| TTI | 3.5s | 2.1s | -40% |

Exceeded our 40% improvement target! 🎯

### Key Optimizations

1. **Code splitting**: Split vendor chunks, lazy load routes
2. **Images**: WebP format, responsive srcset, lazy loading
3. **Caching**: Redis for API responses (5 min TTL)
4. **DB**: Added indexes, optimized N+1 queries

### Lessons Learned

- Always measure before optimizing
- Small changes compound (38% total from many 5-10% wins)
- Lighthouse is great but also test on real devices

## 🗓️ Tomorrow

- Start mobile push notifications
- ML model training
